Building a cloud based learning management System (LMS) exclusively for AR/VR
courses with user authentication, Custom UI, certificate generation and students to
know their performance.

System Requirements
- Client needs a full scale, cloud deployed LMS to create, publish and host
courses, and issue certifications to students.
- Certification issuance implies the LMS must also have an exams and grading
module.
- The LMS should be able to host documents (assignments / books / paper /
reading material)
- The LMS should be able to stream VoD (as course content will be largely in
video mode), and render in multiple qualities and playback speeds
- This involves all principles of HLS or DASH streaming protocols and
caching to improve serving performance.
- Students should be able to see their progress in the courses they have
enrolled.
- OpenEdx’s Tutor distribution was configured to suit client’s requirements
- Tutor has been deployed on an AWS EC2 instance.
- DNS: Porkbun
- Video serving Platform: Vimeo.
